Why is the TOAD schema compare not as nice as one we can build ourselvs?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Toad schema compare can only do one schema at a time.  We can do all three application schema!!1!



will do these in first cut:
---------------------------
table&cols
view&cols
indexes & index cols
constraints & cons cols
synonyms (public and private) for application objects


will wait on these:
-------------------
types/type bodies
partitions and subpartitions for partitioned tables and indexes
packages/package bodies/procedures/functions
triggers
database links
jobs/scheduler jobs
object privs on application objects
sys privs for application schemas
granted roles and role privs for application schemas.


First cut:
----------
a simple SQL*Plus script run from my workstation.  
It will create DB links to my account in the baseline and target databases
run "Diff" queries against the data dictionary and print the output (html output?)

ideas for future attempts:
--------------------------
a package (publicly executable) will capture data dictionary snapshots.
This info is stored in some tables in a repository schema.
we execute this pacakge at each deploy.
another procedure in the same package will create a report of datamodel changes between
the first snapshot and the most recent snapshot.
